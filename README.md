# GMVerlet-Integration
Very experimental. Made mostly for a game project for visuals, never ended up using it.

Verlet Integration for GameMaker Studio 2.3.1+

Feel free to use at your own leisure or help update. 

Features include:

-Creating points/squares/custom shapes with physics. (via point_add/stick_add or the relative verlet_square_create, etc)

-Displaying sprites via (image_push or image_struct) 

-Basic room constraints (set to be between 0 to room boundaries)
